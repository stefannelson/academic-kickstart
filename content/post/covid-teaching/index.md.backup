The more and more I work in these times that we live in, I can't have but think how apt a term like "baptism by fire" truly is. I am currently in my third semester of teaching, the second at the community college I am employed at. The students I teach are either in the middle or end of the three-class remedial math sequence. I have come to greatly appreciate the variety of students that come through my classroom, whether they be recent high school graduates to returning students with numerous different life experiences. 

For the sake of sticking to what I knew, I set up my courses to be very much in line with how I was educated. The classes has a loop of lecture, group work, and homework up until the unit exam. Then, the Coronavirus hit. 

It turns out that this simple class organization does not transfer over well to a crisis situation, who knew? I tried running lectures via Zoom at the normal class time, but this turned out to alienate my students who lived without a stable wifi connection. This turns out to be a significant chunk of my class as some students originally traveled from remote parts of Northern Arizona to get to campus. Steaming video was not an option. 

I then turned to Youtube. I created lectures utilizing the free applications [Open Broadcaster Software Studio (OBS)](https://obsproject.com/) and [Xournal++](https://github.com/xournalpp/xournalpp). These tools have been invaluable to recording lectures with minimal overhead. Given that I have a second job, this has been vital to keeping myself on track and getting content distributed to my students quickly.

The strategy mentioned above has been moderately successful. I set up one-on-one appointments via Zoom, and many of my students watched these lectures and referenced back to them as they worked through their homework. There are a few changes I want to implement for a Fall 2020 section of this course, however:

1. **The lectures were way too long**. I watched an excellent webinar later into the semester which focused on the importance of creating microlectures (see [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twuxpMTjxUI)). I did not account for the effect of lowered attention spans in both an online environment on top of being in the midst of a global pandemic. Thankfully, my system in OBS can account for this given some planning beforehand. Recording and saving a screencast is just a click of a button, so my only modification needed would be to structure my lectures into smaller, *thematic* fragments.
2. **Youtube videos are not inherently accessible**. As previously mentioned, I quickly turned away from synchronous meetings over Zoom in part due to streaming video being so data-heavy. While asynchronous lectures via Youtube is a better option, it is still not ideal. Some options I have been debating involve transcripts of my lectures with $\LaTeX$ formatting and/or audio recordings. This is definitely still a work in progress.

During this unprecedented time, it has been widely accepted that online class implementations were going to be far from perfect. Overall, my students this semester have been engaged with the material even though some sacrifices were made. I was still able to provide feedback to their individual work that they can take into the following modules. There is still so much room for improvement.

In the next part, I will outline my plan for teaching my online classes moving forward. Stay tuned!
