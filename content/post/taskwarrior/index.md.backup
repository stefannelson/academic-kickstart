I have been fascinated in improving the way I work for some time. When I first attempted graduate school (Mathematics Education with a Graduate Teaching Assistantship), I had very few coping skills in dealing with a intensive workload like this. For the sake of my mental health and mitigating any burnout resulting from completing my undergraduate degree, I ended up taking a year to complete a term of national service with AmeriCorps VISTA. This gave me a unique opportunity to grow professionally by taking a magnifying glass to my habits. What follows is an overview of the applications that have helped me become organized, focused, and inspired.

## Preliminaries - What does a productivity system look like?

I have always found disconnecting from work to be a difficult task. I wanted to change that, which led me to finding applications that can act as a "second brain" of sorts. The requirements I came up with include:

1. A task repository. 
2. A calendar.
3. A time tracker. 
3. A database for documents/books to read and annotate.

With the aspects of the system in place, I wanted the application choices to be, above all, inexpensive and sustainable. For example, a popular to-do list manager I found in my research over and over again was Todoist. While I think it is an excellent app, many of its best features are for premium users only. What's worse, Todoist runs the risk of going the way of the "Wunderlist." If Todoist was to be sold, the entire service could be shut down, forcing all users to migrate to something else. I want to avoid that. 

## What applications made the cut?

For my money, Taskwarrior is the finest task manager ever developed.
