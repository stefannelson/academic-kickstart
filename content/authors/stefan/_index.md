I am a graduate research assistant at [Northern Arizona University](https://www.nau.edu) with a Computational Mathematics degree from [Minnesota State University Moorhead](https://www.mnstate.edu) with minors in Statistics and Astronomy. My research involves post-quantum cryptography.

While completing my undergraduate degree, I discovered a love for education that brought me to Flagstaff, AZ. Since mid-2018, I have taught at Northern Arizona University, Coconino Community College, and W.F. Killip Elementary School in various capacities. I value the power of STEM in not only creating opportunities for efficiency, security, and evidence-based decision making in education, but also to empower underrepresented communities. 

I would love to connect with you! Please feel free to contact me using any of the avenues off to the side.
